# NCCNPApp
This application was created for the North Carolina Center for Non-profits. 
It digitizes their capacity building process where the NCCNP delivers recommendations, goals, and action steps to nonprofits.
The nonprofit fills out a survey from NCCNP's Survey Monkey account. The survey responses are then exported and uploaded to this application.
NCCNP employees can write recommendations, goals, and action steps concurrently with other NCCNP employees in response to survey responses.
Once all work is complete, a document with recommendations, goals, and or action steps, can be exported and shared with the nonprofit.

The application is currently hosted on a free web hosting site/server for use by NCCNP.
For future development of this application, please contact me at bunnbebe@gmail.com.
